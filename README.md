# augustcoman-release-f22
A collection of coding projects done for CS225. Each individual project is located within their respective folders named accordingly.

### mp_traversals
This project explores breadth-first and depth-first traversals in a 2-dimensional grid. An algorithm was written for these grid traversals, and additional code was written to allow this to be performed on a specified image. A gif image file was generated with the written code. This is located in `mp_traversals/build/myFloodFill2.gif`.
